 - Gamify by granting XP on completion of objects
        -Creates need for xp bar, and account stats and stuff
- Add in global x/y completed
- Add in templates for [workouts, cooking, programming excersizes]
- Add in functionality to be able to move children around (Drag and drop? or just dropdown list then export child?)
- Add database triggers for INSERT on todo.todo_children and UPDATE ON todo.todo_children.completed 
        - to fill a column for x/y completed
